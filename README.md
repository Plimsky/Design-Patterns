# Design Patterns

## The goal
This repo is intended to be a source of information, explanations and examples for Design Patterns.
Most of these DPs will be explained and demonstrated through the theme of video games.

DPs are often used as "solutions" to architectural problems and specific needs.

## Why the video game theme?
Because it's my main field of work and because a playful example will always be easier to understand than something abstract and boring.

## Why C++?
Because it's a powerful language and is frequently used in the video game industry. It allows us to develop gameplay features, tools and even game engines! The examples will be based on a modern version: C++17. 

## For who?
Anyone who would be interested in learning design patterns, out of curiosity, for study, or to review.

## Credits
Some examples / Inspirations may come from different sources. This repo is just meant to be a compilation of different data to make things a little bit easier to get in the whole.
